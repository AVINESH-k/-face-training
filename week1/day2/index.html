    <h2>INGREDIENT CHOCOLATE ICE CREAM</h2>
    <p>   I love ice creams. I first had the idea of making homemade ice cream during one of our science experiments involving ice.
        It is that experiment where a bag of heavy cream is placed on bag with salted ice. And when the bag was shaken,
        the heavy cream turned into instant ice cream. My very first homemade ice cream was made when I was in elementary, using this process.
        But the only problem is that I cannot produce large quantity of ice cream using this process. 
        I then researched on how to make homemade ice creams and immediately bought a hand-mixer.</p>
